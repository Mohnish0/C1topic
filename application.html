                Hello, my name is <a href="https://github.com/Mohnish0"> Mohnish Sharma(2110994774) </a> this is
                basic webpage to introduce myself and provide a short description of units i have already completed. I
                am currently studying software engineering from Deakin University there were many interisting
                unitd in this course like SIT-210 Embedded System development in which we were taught
                about the basic woring of Arduio Uno and other boards like Arduino Mega. We also had
                a unit SIT-217 Robotics in which we had to make a team project and also learned how to make working
                projects. <br>
                <br>
                Now we have this unit which has started off really well and this will be really useful to use in our
                future also. Making projects in this unit will surely help us to learn a lot and increase our
                experience in this unit as well.
